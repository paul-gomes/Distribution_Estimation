# Project 1 - Distribution estimation

### Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

GMMs assume that there are a certain number of Gaussian distributions, and each of these distributions represent a cluster. Hence, a Gaussian Mixture Model tends to group the data points belonging to a single distribution together. GMMs are probabilistic models and use the soft clustering approach for distributing the points in different clusters.
Gaussian distribution or normal distribution has a bell-shaped curve, with the data points symmetrically distributed around the mean value. It runs expectation-maximization algorithm that has E-step and M-step. It runs the E-Step and the M-Step iteratively and maximize the log likelihood function until it converges.
